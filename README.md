Learning GraphQL
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with GraphQL. Here, I will document and share what I learn about GraphQL, its concepts, implementation, and best practices.

About GraphQL
GraphQL is an open-source query language and runtime for APIs. It was developed by Facebook and has gained popularity for its flexible and efficient approach to data fetching. GraphQL allows clients to request specific data and shape the response according to their needs, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

Getting Started
If you're new to GraphQL, I recommend starting with the following resources:

Official GraphQL Documentation: The official GraphQL documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the language, its features, and how to get started.
How to GraphQL: This website offers a step-by-step tutorial that covers various GraphQL concepts and provides hands-on examples.
